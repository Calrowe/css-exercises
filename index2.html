		<main>		
		<p>You are the fierce viking warrior Brynolf, son of Ulfrick, and you
		<br>are on one of many boats raiding the coasts of England. You jump
		<br>ashore with you your fellow mates at yet another monastery that 
		<br>looks like an easy raid. You first walk towards it and after they
		<br>noticed you and their bells start to chime you all start to run
		<br>with a roar of combat. 
		<br>Halfway there arrows from the forest nearby starts to rain down on you
		<br>and your chieftain yells:
		<br>"Quick! Change course towards the forest! Shields in front"
		<br>You all run towards the bowmen and soldiers at the forestline but half-
		<br>way there suddenly arrows starts to rain over you from behind.
		<br>"Dammit! Its a trap! Keep the course!", chieftain Olaf screams to his
		<br>men. When you finally reach the forest over half of your fellow soldiers
		<br>has allready fallen from the arrows. The english soldiers are now more 
		<br>than thrice as many any the battle stands in their favor.
		<br>An arrow just misses your head. You look around and you find the bowman.
		<br>He quickly shoots down two of your friends.
		<br>"If I am only going to slay one of them, it should be him", you think 
		<br>for youself. As if he had read your mind the bowman quickly dissappears
		<br>into the forest. 
		<br>
		<br>What do you do?
